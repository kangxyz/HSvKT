# HSvKT

In [`HSvKT.agda`](/HSvKT.agda), it proves the direct colimit of the inductive family `Word` admits the eliminator introduced by [Kraus-von Raumer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06022). This result establishes its equivalence to the path space of a homotopy pushout. The inductive family is closely related to the zig-zag construction presented by [WÃ¤rn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12339). It is likely straightforward to show they are actually the same thing, as is already demonstrated in the case of James construction.
