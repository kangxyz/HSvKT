# HSvKT

In [`HSvKT.agda`](/HSvKT.agda), it proves the direct colimit of the inductive family `Word` admits the eliminator introduced by [Kraus-von Raumer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06022). This result establishes its equivalence to the path space of a homotopy pushout. The inductive family is similar to the zig-zag construction presented by [Wärn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12339).
