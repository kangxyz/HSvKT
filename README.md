# HSvKT

In [`HSvKT.agda`](/blob/main/HSvKT.agda), it proves the direct colimit of an inductive family `Word` admits the eliminator given by Kraus-von Raumer, which shows its equivalence to the path space of a homotopy pushout. The inductive family is similar to the zig-zag construction given by WÃ¤rn, and it should not be too difficult to prove they are actually the same thing, as is already done in the James construction.
