# HSvKT

In [`HSvKT.agda`](/HSvKT.agda), it proves the direct colimit of an inductive family `Word` admits the eliminator given by [Kraus-von Raumer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06022), which shows its equivalence to the path space of a homotopy pushout. The inductive family is similar to the zig-zag construction given by [WÃ¤rn](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12339), and it should not be too difficult to prove they are actually the same thing, as is already done in the James construction.
